# OIT-challenge

I used MinGW as a software to allow me to compile the main.cpp file in the windows terminal.
Here is the guide I used to set it up: https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/#setting-up-path-variable

I spent 3 hours coding up the solution to the challenge.

Thank you for the opportunity!
